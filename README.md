# TAMIDS

At the TAMU Datathon during Fall 2024 Semester, we created a Global Commodity Data Explorer using Machine Learning and SKLearn libraries. Along with that, we also implemented a user-friendly interactive platform that users can use to analyze trends in commodity prices over time across multiple countries globally.
